        "Try the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused study, then a 5-minute break to keep the good vibes going. During breaks, do something light and enjoyable like stretching, sipping water, or listening to your favorite upbeat song.",
        "Celebrate your progress by reviewing what you've learned today—it'll boost your confidence! Write down three key things you mastered, no matter how small, and remind yourself that consistency builds success.",
        "Channel your positivity into teaching someone else what you just studied. Explaining a concept aloud or writing it as if teaching can deepen your understanding and reinforce your memory.",
        "Use your high energy to plan ahead: organize your notes, create a study timetable, or map out difficult concepts you'll conquer next. Preparation today makes tomorrow easier and more productive."

    "😞 Negative": [
        "Start with a small, manageable task to build momentum, as small wins can lift your spirits. For example, read one page, solve a single problem, or write a short summary. That spark of progress will push you forward.",
        "As Thomas Edison said, 'I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.' Remember that mistakes are not signs of weakness but stepping stones to mastery. Each attempt builds resilience and insight.",
        "Study in a comfortable space with some light background music to ease your mind. Create an environment that feels calm, with minimal distractions, maybe add a cup of tea or water nearby to refresh yourself.",
        "Practice self-kindness: remind yourself that it's okay to have off days. Instead of pushing too hard, choose gentle learning methods like watching an explainer video, using flashcards, or revising notes in smaller portions.",
        "Visualize your end goal—a completed degree, a rewarding career, or simply understanding this one tough topic. Motivation often comes when we reconnect with the bigger picture of why we started studying in the first place."
    ],
    "😐 Neutral": [
        "Break your study session into smaller chunks to maintain focus and avoid overwhelm. Aim for 30–40 minutes of active learning followed by a meaningful 10-minute break where you relax or stretch.",
        "Try summarizing key points in your own words to make studying more engaging. Creating mind maps, flowcharts, or simple doodles can make abstract ideas more concrete and easier to recall later.",
        "Set a clear goal for this session, like mastering one concept, to stay on track. Clarity fuels productivity—write your goal on a sticky note and place it where you can see it as a reminder.",
        "Use active recall by closing your notes and testing yourself on what you just learned. This strengthens memory and helps you identify knowledge gaps you might miss with passive rereading.",
        "Switch up your study method to spark engagement—if you usually read, try recording yourself explaining the topic, or quiz yourself with flashcards. A slight change in routine can reignite focus."
